I am Julio Salas, a passionate and dedicated second-generation Colombian and Mexican immigrant, born and raised in the vibrant community of Corona, Queens, New York. As the eldest of four siblings, I have been profoundly influenced by my mother, Angela, who tragically passed away from COVID-19 in 2021, and my grandmother, who continues to be a pillar of strength for our family.

I am a Sociology PhD student and Chancellorâ€™s fellow at UC Berkeley, where my research explores the intersections of immigration, emotion, race, ethnicity, social stratification, and health. My current study focuses on how Latinx immigrant families have grieved during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting my commitment to addressing social inequalities and producing impactful knowledge.

My academic journey took a pivotal turn when I chose to forgo medical school in favor of sociology, driven by my love for thinking, reading, and writing, and a deep belief in the power of my own voice. Inspired by my mother's selflessness and a desire to make a difference, I view my work as a creative endeavor aimed at making others' lives easier and fuller, even at a personal cost.

I strive to embody resilience and intellectual curiosity, to honor my family's legacy, and to uplift my community. My ultimate goal is to invoke hope and take actionable steps toward a better future, using my research and writing to give voice to the unheard and create meaningful change in the world.
