As a Chancellorâ€™s Fellow and first-year PhD student, my research focuses on the experiences of immigrant families, particularly at the intersections of immigration, race and ethnicity, emotion, social stratification, and health. I explore how immigrants are racialized and how this racialization is embodied, influencing the inequalities they face. 

I'm delving into the complex impacts of systemic racism and discrimination on the health and well-being of immigrant families. By examining these factors, I aim to reveal the emotional and physical toll of being treated as an outsider.

Understanding and addressing health inequalities among immigrant populations is crucial. Immigrants face unique challenges, including limited access to healthcare, economic instability, and cultural barriers, all of which can worsen health issues.

Highlighting the connections between racialization and health can inform policymakers, healthcare providers, and community organizations about the specific needs of immigrant families. My research has the potential to foster more inclusive and equitable health policies and practices.

Ultimately, I aim to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to lead healthy, fulfilling lives. 

**My work is about creating a more just and understanding society for everyone.**
