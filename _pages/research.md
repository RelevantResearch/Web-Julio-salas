As a Chancellorâ€™s Fellow and second-year PhD student, my research focuses on the experiences of immigrant families living in the United States, particularly at the intersections of immigration, emotion, race and ethnicity, social stratification, and health. Since getting to Berkeley, I'm thinking a lot about how immigrants are racialized and the embodiment of said racialization and their implications for the inequality and emotions they experience.
