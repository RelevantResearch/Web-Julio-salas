[My research](https://julio.relevant-research.com/research) centers the experiences and voices of immigrant families living in the United States and focuses on immigration, race & ethnicity, emotion, inequality, and health. My current study examines how Latino/a/e/x immigrant families grieved during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. My first co-authored academic article in the *Journal of Nutrition and Education Behavior* qualitatively evaluated an online meal kit and grocery platform for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients. Much of my work at the Urban Institute focused on the social safety net and immigration. You can view my published work on my [publications page](https://julio.relevant-research.com/publications).
