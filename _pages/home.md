[My research](https://julio.relevant-research.com/research) focuses on immigration, race/ethnicity, emotion, social stratification, and health. I am currently conducting research in Mexico and New York City. My first co-authored academic article published in *The Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior* assessed the impact of online approaches to expanding access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in New York.
